## What I learnt from this Project:

- Understood that `max-w-[]` or `max-width` property doesnt exactly work on `img`, it works on `div` that encloses the image.
- Used grid quite a lot in this project, simplifying the work for responsiveness.
- Usage of `object-cover` and `h-full` on certain images for successfully imitating the original shopify website features.
